We were able to update all of our description based on the comments made from the TA, I was able to make the draw function work properly as well as having the app not crash from the view controller to the save share screen. We might have to make some modification for the shape in brush stroke seemed a bit confusing so as of right now it is commented out. I was able to set up the table View and need to combine it with what my teammate had forked on being the persistent storage to have the load previously made images accessible and editable.
